_**Are you getting an error?** Sometimes updates in Tor Browser itself will break Tor Browser Launcher. There's a good chance that the problem you're experiencing has already been fixed in the [newest version](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/torbrowser-launcher/-/tags). Try installing from Flatpak (instructions below), or [build from source](/BUILD.md)._
 - [ ] I am using the latest version and the problem persists.
