Tor Browser Launcher
====================

Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier to
maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. You install torbrowser-launcher from your
distribution's package manager and it handles downloading the most recent
version of TBB for you, in your language and for your architecture. It also
adds a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your operating system's menu.

When you first launch Tor Browser Launcher, it will download TBB from
https://www.torproject.org/ and extract it in ~/.torproject, and then execute
it. When you run it after that it will just execute TBB.

Tor Browser Launcher will get updated each time a new version of TBB is
released. When you open Tor Browser after an update, it will download the newer
version of TBB for you and extract it over your old TBB directory in
~/.torproject, so you will maintain your TBB bookmarks.

  apt-get install tor python-gtk2 gnupg python-twisted

Building
--------

To build a Debian source package:

  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command sdist_dsc

To build a Debian binary package:

  python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb

Installing

Once you've made a .deb, you can install by running this as root:

  dpkg -i deb_dist/torbrowser-launcher_VERSION_all.deb
